      "Here go the Knicks and the Cavaliers, striding confidently into NBA spring, and all anyone wants to talk about is last summer.",
      "That\u2019s how it sounds, at least, as so much chatter focuses on Donovan Mitchell, the scoring star Cleveland traded for, and the guy New York eschewed. Even Mitchell, a New York native, seemed surprised that the Knicks opted out of talks with Utah, preferring not to part with young pieces and draft picks. The Knicks signed free-agent guard Jalen Brunson, nurtured along the likes of Immanuel Quickley, Quentin Grimes and others, picked up spark plug Josh Hart in February, and turned it all into the fifth seed in the East. They\u2019re making their second postseason appearance in the past 10 years, which makes it hard to quibble with the results.",
      "Cleveland showed no such hesitancy, though. It put together a hefty package to the Jazz\u2019s liking to bring in precisely the sort of star it needed. Mitchell responded with the best of his five NBA seasons, averaging a career-high 28.3 points and making every other Cavalier a little better with his presence.",
      "",
      "Now, for many, the outcome of this series will serve as a sort of referendum. If the Knicks prevail, they will have made the more prudent move. If the Cavaliers advance, they went big and avoid going home.",

      "NBA TV previews the Knicks-Cavaliers first-round matchup.",
      "3 Things To Watch",
      "1. Mitchell vs. Brunson.As noted above, these are the two additions who elevated their teams into the playoffs. Each led his team in scoring during the four regular-season matchups, Mitchell putting up 31.8 points against New York (38 in the first meeting) while Brunson burned Cleveland for 25.3 points (48 in the most recent clash). The Knicks guard doesn\u2019t dominate the ball quite as much as Mitchell, but he\u2019ll be the one they look to late in clocks. For a reference point, when Dallas beat Utah in six games last spring in the West, Brunson averaged 27.8 points and shot 48.4% to Mitchell\u2019s 25.5 on 39.8% shooting.",
      "2. Cavs\u2019 D vs. Knicks\u2019 O.Which blinks first? In their four games vs. New York this season, the Cavaliers \u2013 who had the top-ranked defense this season at 109.9 points per 100 possessions \u2013 saw it slip to 112.7. Then again, the Knicks had a 117.0 offensive rating overall, compared to that 112.7 vs. Cleveland. The slow pace at which Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff likes to play might have a big say in this, but New York is capable \u2013 its coach is Tom Thibodeau, after all \u2013 of grinding gears in a half-court slog.",
      "3. Where\u2019s Danny?When the Cavaliers acquired veteran guard Danny Green in February, the idea was that his vast postseason resume would be as valuable as his flypaper defense and 3-point range at precisely this point on the calendar. It all still might happen, but Green has played only 71 minutes in seven appearances for Cleveland (14 DNPs) and this is the time of year rotations get tighter. It might not make or break the Cavaliers\u2019 outlook but his involvement bears watching.",
      "X-Factor",
      "Julius Randle will be the center of attention \u2014 if he\u2019s able to play at full strength after an ankle injury.",
      "Until Julius Randle removes the \u201c?\u201d from his sprained left ankle, he gets the \u201cX\u201d here. Randle got hurt two weeks ago against Miami, has been hobbling in a walking boot and is due for a re-evaluation in the next few days. If he\u2019s not able to compete or even is limited, he could be headed for a repeat of last spring when he launched 18.8 shots per game to average 18 points and shot 29.8% in the five-game elimination by Atlanta. Half-full Knicks fans will be looking for the two-time All-Star and possible All-NBA selection to test Cleveland\u2019s Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen inside and out.",
      "Number To Know",
      "+5.6 \u2014The Cavs were tied forthe league\u2019s fifth-best record, but had the second-best point differential, both on aper-100-possessions(+5.6) andper-game(+5.4) basis. They ranked higher than the Milwaukee Bucks (best record in the league) in both offensive and defensive efficiency and were one ofthree teamsthat ranked in the top 10 on both ends of the floor. Statistically, they were a much better team than their record would indicate.",
      "The Cavs were 24-21 (10th best) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, and 27-10 (second best) otherwise, leading the league with 33 double-digit wins. That was the league\u2019s biggest such differential, and this was the second straight season where Cleveland wasn\u2019t as good in close games as it was otherwise. The Cavs\u2019 defense was solid in clutch situations, but they hadthe league\u2019s 20th-ranked clutch offense, with Darius Garland (21-for-62, 33.9%) being one ofseven playerswho shot worse than 35% on at least 50 clutch field goal attempts.",
      "Julius Randle was one of the other six and the Knicks were also worse in clutch games (23-22) than they were otherwise (24-13). Three ofthe four regular-season meetingswere within five points in the last five minutes, with the Knickswinning two of those three.",
      "\u2014 John Schuhmann",
      "The Pick",
      "No Randle, no shot for New York. If he\u2019s back and nearly 100%, this figures to be a long series. Both coaches preach defense, both have solid rim protection, and both have dynamic point guards driving their attacks. If Mitchell Robinson and Allen cancel each other out in the paint, the versatile Mobley might prove to be the difference, bothering the Knicks from various spots at both ends. The Cavaliers probably face a bit more pressure but they have home court to start and to finish. That should get it done.Cavaliers in 7.",

      "The not-so-good news is that the Kings must face the NBA\u2019s defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, who clinched the final full-fledged playoff berth on the regular season\u2019s final day and seemed so pleased, it was as if Stephen Curry and crew had planned it that way all along.",

      "The Kings legitimately see themselves as favorites. They have a pair of All-Stars in Domantas Sabonis and De\u2019Aaron Fox surrounded by a strong ensemble cast. Their breathtaking offensive rating of 118.6 dwarfs anything Golden State was putting up in its golden era (2015-19).",
      "They also won the Pacific Division but wound up only four victories ahead of the Warriors overall, and Golden State took three of the teams\u2019 four meetings.

Fox averaged 25.2 points per game, made his first All-Star team and established himself asone of the NBA\u2019s most \u201cclutch\u201d players. Curry\u2019s 29.5 ppg didn\u2019t show up among the official leaders because injuries cost him too many games. But ask many scouts which guy they\u2019d rather have with the ball in his hands late, it\u2019s Curry. This matchup could start to change that.",
      "2. Playoff Sabonis. The Kings\u2019 All-Star center, who will get some Kia MVP love when ballots are counted, averaged 19.1 ppg, 12.3 rpg and 7.3 apg on 61.5% shooting. He also joined elite company by becoming only the third center in NBA history with at least 1,500 points, 900 rebounds and 500 assists in a season (The previous two? Wilt Chamberlain and Nikola Jokic). Now it needs to transfer to the postseason. Sabonis has only played in 13 playoff games, none since 2019 with Indiana, and his stats are mere shells of the player he is now: 9.6 ppg, 4.8 rpg and 1.6 apg.",
      "3. Counting by threes. Twenty players made 200 or more 3-pointers this season, and five of them are in this series: Curry, Thompson and Jordan Poole for the Warriors, Kevin Huerter and rookie Keegan Murray for the Kings. Thompson became only the third player in NBA history to reach 300 (301), joining Curry and James Harden on that list. Murray (206) zoomed by Donovan Mitchell\u2019s 2017-18 rookie record (187).

      "Andrew Wiggins.He redefined his career last season, earning an All-Star spot and, with his two-way play, proving himself to be Golden State\u2019s third best player right through the 2022 championship run. This year has been a mess, though, with a month in the middle lost to injuries and illness, then absent from the final 35 gamesdue to personal leavefor an apparent family issue. Finally last week, Wiggins came back, embraced by his teammates and coaches and immersed in conditioning work to be ready for the second season. If he is mentally present, the 6-foot-7 wing should be physically ready for the demands ahead, with his shooting (38.6% on threes as a Warrior) and on-ball defense restoring some of Golden State\u2019s strengths.",

The lineup averaged just 12.2 minutes per game in the regular season and over their six runs to the finals, the most any Warriors lineup (that played in at least five games) averaged in the playoffs was14.4 minutes per game. So, even if Andrew Wiggins is a full-go for Game 1, minutes from the Warriors\u2019 bench (which ranked17thin the regular season) will be critical.",
      "Sacramento\u2019s starting lineup played 900 minutes together,162 morethan any other five-man unit in the league.

A key for the Kings will be making sure they stay in contact with the defending champs in the first six minutes of the first and third quarters, knowing that they should have an advantage with reserves on the floor.",

      "It\u2019s puzzling that these teams have never met in the playoffs \u2013 in their California incarnations, anyway \u2013 until you look at their timelines. The Kings qualified only twice and quickly were dispatched in the 13 years from 1986 through 1998. Then they made the playoffs eight consecutive years, and then not at all since 2006. Golden State missed every year from 1999-2006, part of a 1-in-18-year playoff drought. They rarely have been good at the same time, but they are now. The Warriors\u2019 timing in health and pride in keeping its window propped open just a tad longer will help exploit the Kings\u2019 playoff training wheels.Warriors in 7."

      "How far will Kevin Durant (left) take Phoenix in the 2023 playoffs?",
      "Kevin Durant changes everything. When he arrived in Phoenix at midseason following a forcedtradefrom the Nets, the Suns\u2019 playbook and scouting report suddenly became outdated. Durant is such a game-changer \u2014 as a scorer, impact player, clutch player \u2014 that he can disrupt the dynamics of any team he joins, in a good way of course.",
      "This comes as a disappointment to the Clippers, still trying to cash in four years after getting Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, and raising the hopes and chances of a title for the other team In LA. Injuries managed to place a speed bump in that road, and oh look, George enters this series with a limp,still smarting from a knee injurythat may reduce his effectiveness. That\u2019s a tough pill to swallow for the Clippers, who did a solid job in surrounding those two stars with help and depth. That said, the Clippers are built around Kawhi and PG, so any absence by one of them is costly.",

      "3 things to watch",
      "1. Kawhi Leonard vs. Kevin Durant.The Clippers really lack anyone with the size to effectively eyeball KD on defense, but they do have the quality in Kawhi. Which means we\u2019ll see this mano a mano for scattered minutes throughout each game. The Clippers would be foolish to assign Kawhi on KD for generous minutes and risk Kawhi getting into foul trouble; given Paul George\u2019s questionable health, that would be detrimental to LA. Kawhi is an elite defender, or at least had that reputation before the injuries, and KD, who has averaged 26 points on 57% shooting with the Suns, is an elite scorer. This is easily the must-see matchup of the series.",
      "2. Chris Paul\u2019s impact.He\u2019s coming off a season where almost everything about his game plummeted, at least compared to his career averages and reputation. This is understandable given Paul is 37; still, his production will be critical to the Suns\u2019 chances. Here\u2019s what\u2019s in his favor: LA lacks an All-Star point guard to match against him. While Russell Westbrook has shown signs of life since arriving, he\u2019s still too unpredictable and prone to turnovers and shots he either misses or passes up. If CP is the best point guard on the floor this series, that might not be saying much, but it\u2019ll go a long way to helping the Suns offensively, since he\u2019s still the best ball distributor on the club.",
      "Paul George's availability looms large over first-round seres",
      "3. Paul George.Well, of course, this is the key to the series. George injured his knee on March 21, hasn\u2019t broken a sweat since, and the Clippers are not expecting him to return for the start of the series, at least. Obviously his worth to LA, and this series, is massive. George remains one of the league\u2019s better two-way players and his defense especially will aid the Clippers against Booker, who brings the skills to drop 40 points or even more on any given night. But if George isn\u2019t 100%, how can he expect to keep up with one of the game\u2019s great all-around shooters off the bounce? In addition, the Clippers could use his 24 points per game and creativity, along with his tag-team ability with Kawhi. In this situation PG better not stand for Probably Gone.",
      "X-Factor",
      "With Paul George missing the start of the series, Norman Powell will be even more important to the Clippers\u2019 chances.",
      "Norman Powell, Clippers.Outside of PG and Kawhi, was the most consistent and dependable player on the Clippers roster this season. He emerged as one of the game\u2019s best sixth men with solid play, averaging 17 points in 26 minutes and serving as a security blanket whenever Kawhi or PG couldn\u2019t suit up. Well, well, well: PG is dealing with health issues and the Clippers will need a surplus of minutes and production from their trusty swingman, who has come through in such emergency situations. Powell brings decent shooting range (40%) and also a strong body to match up defensively. Of all the Clippers not named Kawhi and PG, he\u2019s the one who gives coach Ty Lue the fewest reasons for worry.",

The latter is the highest true shooting percentage in NBA history for any player who\u2019s averaged at least 25 points in 25 games or more (439 total instances). In short, 2022-23 Kevin Durant was the most efficient high-volume scorer that we\u2019ve ever seen. He shot 67.9% in the paint,an incredible 56.0% from mid-range, 40.4% from 3-point range and91.9% from the free throw line.",

For now, let us assume he will play when the series shifts to LA for Games 3 and 4, but hewill also be hampered. Doesn\u2019t that sound reasonable? Well, that might not be enough for the Clippers, who\u2019ll need a pair of ace defenders to deal with KD and Booker. Those two might average 60 a game. And KD, especially, is eager to distance himself from the Brooklyn Nets experience and also the injuries that cost him following his last championship, with the Warriors. One of these years, the Clippers will enter the playoffs with a clean bill of health and bring a decent chance of at least reaching the NBA Finals.

Jackson scored 31 points or more in three of his last four regular-season appearances. When he\u2019s aggressive, defenses must respect him as well as Ja Morant, who finished ninth this season in paint scoring after leading the league in that stat in 2021-22.

      "Led by star swingman Jayson Tatum, the Celtics have been equally adept at offense and defense this season.",
      "Though the Miami Heat were just not the same team this year, the Boston Celtics are probably happy not to face their South Beach nemesis for the third time in the last four postseasons. Instead, they\u2019ll open the 2023 playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks, who went on the road andbeat the Heatin theAT&T Play-In Tournament. The last timethesetwo teams met in the playoffs (2016 first round), Al Horford was on the Hawks while Marcus Smart is the only Celtics player who remains from that series.",
      "No matter the opponent, the Celtics would be the heavy favorite in this series. They\u2019re the defending Eastern Conference champs and,statistically, they\u2019ve been the best team in the league this season. The Hawks have been terrific offensively over the last couple of months and will have a chance any night that the Celtics aren\u2019t shooting well. But Boston is the better team on both ends of the floor and has, arguably, the two best players in the series. Tougher challenges lay ahead.",

      "Regular-season results:",
      "Nov. 16:Celtics 126, Hawks 101March 11:Celtics 134, Hawks 125April 9:Celtics 120, Hawks 114",
      "With the Bucks, Celtics and 76ers separating themselves in the East, can any lower seed dethrone them come playoff time?",
      "3 things to watch",
      "1. Targeting Trae Young.The Celtics\u2019 offense can be great with ball movement, but they\u2019re also a team that will relentlessly attack the opponents\u2019 weakest defender. There might not be a defender in this league with a bigger target on his chest than Trae Young. We can be sure that whomever Young is guarding will be setting ball screens for Jayson Tatum (who will also set screens for that guy) in an effort to get Young switched onto the guy whoranked sixthin total isolation possessions this season. How well the Hawks scramble out of those situations could determine how long this series lasts.",
      "2. Atlanta\u2019s second chances.The Heatranked fourthin defensive rebounding percentage in the regular season \u2026 only to get destroyed on the glass by the Hawks in the 7-8 Play-In game. The Celtics led the league in defensive rebound percentage in the regular season, but the Hawks\u2019 19.0 second-chance points per game in the season series werethe most for any Boston opponent. One of those games was the last of the season when both teams were resting four of their five starters. But Atlantaranked secondin offensive rebounding percentage after the All-Star break, with Onyeka Okongwu (14.2%) and Clint Capela (12.7%) both rankingin the top 12among individuals.",
      "3. Al Horford\u2019s 3-point shooting.Overhis previous four seasons(2018-19 through 2021-22), Horford shot 35.1% from 3-point range. This season: 44.6%,bestamong 103 players with at least 300 attempts. The Celtics want to shoot a lot of 3s (they rankedsecondin 3-point rate in the regular season), Horford will often be the guy left open after a drive-and-kick sequence, and if he can continue shooting this well, Boston will be extremely potent offensively.",
      "X-Factor",
      "Celtics center Robert Williams III is still working himself into form as the 2023 playoffs begin.",
      "Robert Williams III.Williams played in only 35 games this season, including only seven of the Celtics\u2019 final 18, having also missed seven games in last year\u2019s playoffs. The Celtics wereat their best, especiallydefensively, with Williams on the floor this season and were especially strong (plus-15.9 points per 100 possessions) when he played alongside Horford on the frontline. This matchup may favor lineups with five shooters (Horford at the five), but the Celtics may really need Williams on the glass against the Hawks\u2019 frontline. They\u2019ll certainly need him healthy going forward should they get through this series.",
      "Number to know",
      "3\u2014\u00a0The Celtics ranked second in bothoffensiveanddefensiveefficiency in the regular season, becoming just the third team in the 27 seasons for which we have play-by-play data to rank in the top three on both ends of the floor. The other two were the 2014-15 Warriors (second and first) and the 2016-17 Warriors (first and second), which both won the NBA championship.",
      "The Celtics got off to a hot start, with a ridiculously efficient offense as they won 18 of their first 22 games. But, even if we count the gamesafterthat 18-4 start, they still ranked in the top five on both ends of the floor (fifth offensively,third defensively).",
      "The other two times (over these last 27 seasons) that the Celtics ranked in the top five on both ends of the floor were 2008-09 (when they lost in the conference semis) and 2019-20 (lost in the conference finals). While the other two teams that have ranked in the top three on both ends won the championship, only five of the other 22 that have ranked in the top five on both ends (since 1996-97) have gone on to win the title.",
      "The Pick",
      "The Hawks have had a potent offense under coach Quin Snyder, and they were able to grab a bunch of offensive boards against the Celtics this season. But Boston still won all three meetings, scoring more than125 points per 100 possessions(the best mark for any Hawks opponent) over the three. The Celtics don\u2019t have any weak spots (either offensively or defensively) in their rotation, they execute well on both ends of the floor, and Tatum is a star who was absolutely terrific through the first three rounds of the playoffs last year.Celtics in four.",
